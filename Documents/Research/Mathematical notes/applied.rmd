# Circuits

In this section we will discuss the method of using matrices in solving the potiential and conductance 
problem regarding circuits.

I will assume you can manipulate matrices and use basic linear algebra, I will also assume you can construct 
the incidence matrix of a graph.

## Null-Spaces

Consider an incidence matrix $A$ representing a circuit. 

Then (if we let $\Phi$ be the vector representing the potiential at each node) 
we have $A \Phi = w$ is the potiential difference across each edge.

With this, we see that there is the trivial right null-vector $\Phi_0 = \left(\mathbf{1} \right)$,
as if each node has the same potiential, the the potiential difference across 
each edge is zero. In fact, this is the **only** linearly independent right null-vector of $A$ (given that 
the circuit is connected) since if there is two nodes that have different potiential, 
then of course there is going to be some edge with some potiential difference.

On the other hand, for $-A^T w = f$ where $w$ is the potiential difference across each node,
we have $f$ being the vector representing the *sum* of the potientials out of each node.

Then the dimension of the left null-space of $A$ is represented by the number of "loops" 
of the circuit and we can find the basis of the left null-space by the following method:

1. Let $w_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be the vector representing the path of a loop where $n$ is
the number of edges of the circuit.

2. For each edge the path traverses, put a $1$ in that position if the path follows the 
directed graph and a $-1$ if it goes against it.

3. Fill in the rest with $0$s.

Thus, by rank-nullity, we can easily verify our previous statement that the trivial right-null
vector is the only right-null vector.

## Connected Graphs

The question is what happens when we have two disconnected graphs representing a single 
graph? 

Well, with two disconnected graphs, we can see there are two trivial right-null vectors, 
i.e. $\Phi_0 = \left(\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{0} \right)$ and $\Phi_0' = \left(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{1} \right)$.
We can easily see that our original trivial null-vector is in the span of these two new 
null-vectors.

## Useful Terms 

- $A$ is the *incidence matrix* of the graph

- $K = A^T A$ is the *Laplacian matrix* of the graph

- $C = \text{diag}(c_1, \dots c_n)$ the *conductance* matrix of the graph

- $K_c = A^T C A$ is the *weighted Laplacian matrix* of the graph

- $-A^Tw$ is called the *divergence* of the currents (at the nodes)

- $C_{e}$ is the *effective conductance* of a circuit

## KCL Cannot Hold at All nodes!

Consider the result from the *fundamental theorem of linear algebra*:

- The null space of $A^T$ is orthogonal to the row space of $A$, i.e. $\ker A^T \perp \text{csp} A$.

(This is true because if $v \in \ker A$, then the dot product of $v$ and the rows of $A$ must be 
zero, so it must be perpendicular to the row vectors of $A$. But for all $w \in \text{rsp} A$, 
$w$ is a linear combination of the row vectors of $A$, so $v \cdot w = 0$ and hence, as 
$\text{rsp} A = \text{csp} A^T$, we have $\ker A \perp \text{csp} A^T$.)

With that, let use suppose *KCL* holds at all the nodes. Then, we have $\mathbf{0} = A^T w$ for some 
$w$ representing the potiential difference across each edge. Then, by definition, $w$ is in the 
null-space of $A^T$. But this, by our aforementioned lemma must be perpendicular to any vectors in 
$\text{csp} A = \text{Im} A$ and hence, if $w \neq 0$ (which we are assuming as otherwise we would have 
a circuit not doing anything!) there does not exist some potiential vector $\Phi$ such that $w = A\Phi$.  

Physically, this means that under the assumption that *KCL* holds at all nodes, there will be **no** 
non-trivial potiential that will produce a current through our circuit (but of course the trivial
null-vectors of $A$ satisfy our equation $\mathbf{0} = A^T A \Phi$).

## Method for Finding the Potientials

Just solve $$ f = A^T C A \Phi = K_c \Phi $$ and we are done!

Okay, perhaps this is not very helpful so to expand on what I've said above, let us consider two types
of questions.

### Specified Conductance

First, perhaps we are given the net currents at the boundary nodes, i.e. $f$ is known and we are asked 
to find $\Phi$ such that $f = K_c \Phi$. Then, you might just think to do something like 
$\Phi = K_c ^{-1} f$ to determine $\Phi$. But this is no good as $K_c$ is singular and therefore not 
invertible (recall that we have the trivial null-vector for $A$, $\Phi_0$ so $K_c \Phi_0 = A^T C (A\Phi_0)
= A^T C \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0}$). So what we do is we set one of the nodes to have potiential zero, 
i.e. we will have that node as our reference potiential (if you think about this physically what I'm saying 
is that the potiential at one node doesn't really mean much - its the potiential difference that actually does 
the work so fixing one node potiential doens't effect what we are really after - the potiential difference).

So what we do have now is some mathematical trickery. If we fix the $i$-th nodes to have potiential zero,
then when we multiply $K_c$ with this potiential vector, you can see that the $i$-th row and collumn of $K_c$ 
nolonger contribute to the multiplication so by removing them, we receive a new linear system $K_c' \Phi' = f'$.
Now, by repeating this process until its solvable, we should receive some vector $\bar{x}$ that is satisfied 
by our original system and hence we have a solution space 
$$S = \bar{x} + \ker A := \{\bar{x} + x_0 \mid x_0 \in \ker A \}.$$

### Specified Potientials

So now what if we are given the potientials at the boundary nodes and are asked to find the potientials at the 
non-boundary nodes while also finding the net-currents out of the boundary nodes? 

Well, thats a lot asked from us, but I think we can manage. So in this case we have $K_c \Phi = f$ where 
$\Phi = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots)^T$ and $f = (f_1, -f_1, 0, \dots)^T$ where $x_1, x_2$ are given and we are 
asked to find the rest (if it's not in this form then just rewrite it in this form). And then all we have to do 
is to use the [Schur complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement) and Wikipedia can explain the rest.

One more comment. The effective conductance of the system $C_e = f_1$.

## Calculating the Effective Conductance

We will now present some trickery in calculating the effective conductance of a circuit 
by simplifying the circuit whenever we see edges in series or parallel.

### Edges in Parallel 

Suppose we have the following graph represting a particular section of another graph with parallel edges.

\begin{center}

\tikzset{every picture/.style={line width=0.75pt}} %set default line width to 0.75pt

(327.55,220.4) -- cycle ;

% Text Node

% Text Node
\draw (334,210.4) node [anchor=north west][inner sep=0.75pt]    {$2$};

\end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

Let us write out the incidence matrix and the conductance matrix,
$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1
\end{pmatrix},
\hspace{2mm}
C = 
\begin{pmatrix}
c_a & 0 \\ 0 & c_b
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Then, if let the system have unit potiential at node 1 and zero potiential at node 2, we have 
$$
f = A^T C A \Phi = 
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & -1 \\ 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
c_a & 0 \\ 0 & c_b
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
c_a + c_b \\ -(c_a + c_b)
\end{pmatrix}
$$
implying that for edges in parallel, we shall add the conductance.

### Edges in Series

It's a very similar story for edges in series but the matrices doesn't multiply as nicely so we will omit 
it the proof but the result is that given the below graph,

\begin{center}

\tikzset{every picture/.style={line width=0.75pt}} %set default line width to 0.75pt        

\begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.75pt,y=0.75pt,yscale=-1,xscale=1]

\end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

we can treat the system as one edge with conductance $c_ac_b/(c_a + c_b)$.

# Random Walks 

In this section, we shall examine another system - random walks on a graph and explore 
its similarity to a circuit system. With this, we will conclude that in fact the two 
systems are the same and are said to be *harmonic* and for each method of solving the 
specific problem, an equivalent method can be used for the other.

We shall also consider two additional methods for solving problems involving harmonic 
graphs - *algebraic* and the *method of relaxation*.

## A Stroll Through Central London

Consider the much reduced (an worse) tubemap of central London,

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{./walk.png}
\caption{A fictional tubemap of central London.}
\end{figure}

and suppose, your very drunk friend, Xin, gotten himself wasted at *Station $A$*. 
Wanting to get home, Xin takes a random tube at each station and gets off at the next 
rinse and repeat until he reaches some station we will specify.

We would now like to pose three questions:

1. What is the probability that, if Xin starts at *Oxford Circus*, he reaches *Bond Street* 
before reaching *Green Park*?

2. What is the probability if Xin starts at *Piccadilly Circus* instead?

3. What is the probability that if Xin starts as *Bond Steet* and leaves, he reaches 
*Green Park* rather than returning to *Bond Street*?

### An Recursive Algorithm for Question 1

Often times, it is helpful to first simulate our problem with a computer programme so we can see perhaps 
there is a pattern to our answer. To achieve this however, there are many different methods. Here I have prepared 
a pseudocode representation for a recursive implementation of simulating one random walk however there are 
different ways of achieving the same without recursions.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \SetAlgoLined
  \SetKwFunction{FMain}{walkNext}
  \SetKwProg{Fn}{Function}{:}{}

  \SetKwFunction{CStation}{stations}
  \SetKwProg{Cl}{Class}{:}{}

  \SetKw{kwLet}{let}
  \SetKw{kwChoose}{choose from}
  
  \Cl{\CStation{name, connected}}{
    \kwLet{self.name = name}\;
    \kwLet{self.connected = connected}\;
  }

  \Fn{\FMain{currentStation}}{
    \eIf{currentStation $\neq$ bondStreet $\lor$ greenPark}{
      \FMain{\kwChoose{currentStation.connected}}\;    
    }{
      \Return{currentStation}
    }
  }
 \caption{An recursive method of simulating random walks}
\end{algorithm}

By making each station a data structure containing its name and its adjacent stations, we can recursively 
choose the next station until we reach Bond Street or Green Park.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \SetAlgoLined
  \SetKwFunction{FMain}{walkNext}
  \SetKw{kwPass}{Pass}
  \SetKw{kwLet}{let}

  \kwLet{reachedBondStreet = 0}\;

  \While{runs $\le$ $n$} {
    \eIf{\FMain{oxfordCircus} $=$ bondStreet}{
      bondStreet += 1\;
    }{
      \kwPass
    }
    runs += 1\;
  }

  \kwLet{probability = $reachedBondStreet/n$}
 \caption{Finding the probability given our method of simulating one random walk}
\end{algorithm}

Thus, by doing sufficiently large number of such random walks, we can compare the ratio of the number times 
Xin reached Bond Street against the total number of runs.

By implementing this algorithm in an actual programming language, it seems that this probability 
appears to be around $2 / 5$ which is exactly the same value if we attempted to compute this as if this was 
a circuit with unit conductances on each edge.

This is surprising as on the surface, neither systems seemed to have anything to do with each other, but however, 
later we will find out that both systems are *harmonic* and therefore are essentially the same.

## An Algebraic Method

As promised, I will now present an algebraic method in solving the random walker problem.

Let use first rephrase the question so we can refer to it easier. Consider the graph drawn below.
We can easily see that the graph and the tubemap are infact the same with Bond Street being node 1,
Green Park as node 2 and so on.

With that, we can rephrase the question such that we are asked to find $p_3$ where 
$p_i$ represents the probability of reaching node 1 before reaching node 4.

Consider the *law of total probability*:

- Given a event $E \in \mathcal{F}$ and $B = \{B_i | i \in \mathcal{I}\} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$  for some 
index set $\mathcal{I}$, if $B$ forms a partition of the sample space $\Omega$, then 
$$
P(E) = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}}P(E | B_i)P(B_i).
$$

Then, starting at node 3, we see that Xin can either go to node 1, 2 or 4, so the events of Xin going to node 1, 
node 2 and goint to node 4 partitions the sample space. Therefore by the law of total probability, we have 
$$
p_3 = \frac{1}{3} \times p_1 + \frac{1}{3} \times p_2 + \frac{1}{3} \times p_4.
$$
Similarily, we see that going to node 3 or node 4 from node 2 partitions the sample space, so 
$$
p_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times p_3 + \frac{1}{2} \times p_4.
$$
Now, if we started from node 4, then there is of course no change of reaching node 1 before node 4 (as you 
are aleady at node 4!) so $p_4 = 0$. Similarily if we started from node 1, then the probability of reaching 1 
before 4 is 1, so $p_1 = 1$.

Thus, by plugging in $p_1 = 1$ and $p_4 = 0$, we have a system of equations with two unknowns,
$$
\begin{split}
p_3 & = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} \times p_2 \\
p_2 & = \frac{1}{2} \times p_3
\end{split}
$$
which is easily solvable resulting in $p_3 = 2 / 5$ and $p_2 = 1 / 5$ would you imagine it! It's exactly 
what we expected from the simulated solution (and the same solution as the matrix method).

## Connection Between the Two Systems

Recall our equation for circuits, $f = K \Phi$ where in which at the non-boundary nodes, we had the 
enforcement of *KCL*. So suppose $\phi_i$ is the potiential at a non-boundary node. As *KCL* is upheld at 
this node, we have the $i$-th row of $K \Phi$ being zero. So by denoting $\deg(i)$ by the number of edges 
connected to node $i$, we have 
$$
\deg(i) x_i - \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{j \in \text{connected}\\ \text{nodes}}}} x_j = 0,
$$
so by rearranging, we have,
\begin{equation}
x_i = \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{j \in \text{connected}\\ \text{nodes}}}} x_j/ \deg(i),
\end{equation}
which is exactly what we have done for the algebraic method for random walks.

### Intuitive Interpretation

Intuitively we can interpret both system as graphs with some variables associated with the nodes.
Furthermore, as demonstrated by the above equation, we see that in both system, the node variable of 
each node is the **average** of the its neighbouring node variables. In the case of circuits, the potientials 
(the node variable) of each node is the average of its neighbours (assuming uniform conductance) and 
similarly in the case of the random walk, the probability (the node variable) is the average of its neighbours 
(assuming each path is equally likely).

With that, we can abstract graph systems such as these in which each nodes of the graph is associated with a 
node variable that is the average of its neighbouring nodes and we will call such systems *harmonic*.

And thus, as these systems are essentially the same in our framework, we can utilize a method of one system 
interchangably with another.

### Weighted Harmonic Graphs

However, what if our conductances/ probabilites of going to each neighbouring stations are not the same? 
Then we shall call the harmonic system *weighted*.

As an extention of the regular harmonic system, we see that we do not need to change our original framework much 
but to weight each node variable according to the conductances/ probabilites or whatever other system we are using 
resulting in 
\begin{equation}
x_i = \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{j \in \text{connected}\\ \text{nodes}}}} (x_j/ c_j),
\end{equation}
where $c_j$ denotes the weight we have assigned to the edge connecting the $i$-th node and the $j$-th node.

## Method of Relaxation

With our interpretation in mind, we can now construct another algorithm that converges to our desired 
node variables by averaging the each node variables with the adjacent ones (with weighing dependent one the 
edge variables if the edge variables are not uniform) over and over agains for sufficiently large number of times.

Below are some pseudocode describing this method.

We first create a object called $\tt{Node}$ containing information about its neighbours and it's initial potiential and
we will let a $\tt{graph}$ to be a collection of $\tt{node : Node}$.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \SetAlgoLined
  \SetKwFunction{CNodes}{Node}
  \SetKwProg{Cl}{Class}{:}{}

  \SetKw{kwLet}{let}
  \SetKw{kwDec}{declared}
  
  \Cl{\CNodes{name, nodeVariable, connected, weighing}}{
    \kwLet{self.name = name}\;
    \kwLet{self.connected = connected}\;
    \kwLet{self.$weighing_i$ = $weighing_i$}\;
    \eIf {\kwDec{nodeVariable}}{
      \kwLet{self.nodeVariable = nodeVariable}\;
      \kwLet{self.boundary = True}

    }{
      \kwLet{self.nodeVariable = 0}\;
      \kwLet{self.boundary = False}
    }
  }
  \kwLet{graph = $\{node_1, node_2, \cdots, node_k\}$}\;
 \caption{Constructing the object of nodes and creating a graph as a set of nodes}
\end{algorithm}

Then by looping over all the non-boundary nodes for sufficient amount of times the node variables of 
each node converges to the true value.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \SetAlgoLined
  \SetKw{kwLet}{let}
  \SetKw{kwPass}{Pass}

    \For {node $\in$ graph $\land$ node.boundary $=$ False} {
      node.nodeVariable = $\sum\limits_{\mathclap{i \in node.connected}} weighing_i \times node_i.nodeVariable$
    }
    runs += 1
  } 
 \caption{Constructing the object of nodes and creating a graph as a set of nodes}
\end{algorithm}

# Harmonic Graphs

In this section we shall examine some properties of harmonic graphs. 

## Maximum Principle

Given a harmonic graph, it is rather natural to seperate its nodes into *boundary nodes* and *internal nodes* (all other 
nodes). Then the *maximum principle* states the following:

- For a harmonic graph, the node variables attains maximum and minimum at the boundary nodes.

To see why this is true recall that for a (weighted) harmonic graph, each internal node has node variable that is 
a weighted average of its neighbouring node variables. So if a harmonic graph attains its maximum node variable at 
a internal node, then all nodes adjacent must be less equal to it. However, as the node variable is the weighted 
average of the adjacent node variables, if there is one adjacent node variable strictly less than it, the weighted 
average will be smaller resulting in a contradiction. Therefore, all adjacent nodes must have the same node variable 
as the maximum. Now repeat this until it reaches a boundary node, resulting in our original statement.

The same argument works for the minimum.

## Uniqueness Principle

Given two harmonic graphs, the uniqueness principle states that if the graphs have the same boundary conditions (and 
the same edge variables if it is not uniform), then they also have the same node variables everywhere.

This is true because if we let $x_i$ and $p_i$ denote the $i$-th node variable of the two graphs, then the graph with 
node variables defined by $d_i = x_i - p_i$ attains maximum and minimum at one of its boundary nodes. But at the 
boundary nodes, $x_i = p_i$ implying $\max_j d_j = \min_j dj = 0$ and hence has node variable zero everywhere.

This is a very important principle as this ensures that our solution for the random walk problem is the same as 
the circuit and is the same for any other harmonic graphs for that matter!

## Dirichlet's Principle

The energy dissipation associated with any circuit with two boundary nodes with potiential 1 and 0 is 
defined to be 
$$
\xi(\Phi) = \Phi^T K \Phi
$$
where $K$ is the (weighted) Laplacian and $\Phi$ is any potiential vector. 

Dirichlet's principle states that the potential vector $\Phi_*$ satisfying *KCL* at all internal nodes minimizes 
the energy dissipation, i.e. 
$$\xi(\Phi_*) = \min_\Phi \xi(\Phi).$$

## Thomson's Principle

By mathematical manipulation the energy dissipation from a circuit can also be written as
$$
\begin{split}
\xi(\Phi) = \Phi^T K \Phi & = \Phi^T A^T C A \Phi\\
& = (-A \Phi)^T (-CA \Phi)\\
& = \sum_{\mathclap{k \in \text{edges}}} w_k\left(\frac{w_k}{c_k}\right)\\
& = \hat{\xi}(w),
\end{split}
$$
where $w_k$ is the current in the $k$-th edge and $c_k$ is the conductance in the 
$k$-th edge.

Notice that this new expression of energy dissipation does not have potiential as it's variable but 
the edge currents. So as a corollary of Dirichlet's principle, the current vector such that all 
the internal nodes satisfies *KCL* also minimizes energy dissipation.

## Tellegen's Theorem

Given a circuit with incidence matrix $A$ and any vector $w$ satisfying *KCL* at all nodes 
($w$ does not need to equal some $A\Phi$ for some potiential vector $\Phi$), then for any $e$ 
a potiential difference vector, Tellegen's theorem states,
$$ e^T w = \mathbf{0}. $$

\begin{proof}
Since $e$ is some vector of potiential difference, then there exist some $\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^n$, a potiential 
vector, such that $e = -A\Phi$. Thus
\begin{align*}
e^T w = (- A\Phi)^T w & = - \Phi^T A^T w \\
& = - \Phi^T (w^T A)^T\\
& = - \Phi^T \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0}
\end{align*}
as required.
\end{proof}

Now suppose that $w$ is some vector that satisfies $-A^T w = f$ then for all $e$ a potiential 
difference vector such that $e = -A\Phi$, we have
$$
e^T w = x^T f.
$$

\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
e^T w = (- A\Phi)^T w &= - \Phi^T A^T w \\
& = - \Phi^T (- (- A^T w))\\
& = \Phi^T f. 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Suppose we have two boundary nodes with potiential 1 and 0. Let $w$ be the current in the circuit 
and let $e$ be the potiential difference of the circuit, i.e. $e = -A\Phi$ where $\Phi$ is the potiential 
vector of the circuit. Then the effective conductance is the energy dissipation.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By considering Tellegen's theorem and the fact that other than the two boundary nodes, all other nodes 
satisfy \textit{KCL}, we have
$$
e^T w = x^T f = x_1 C_e + x_0 (-C_e) = C_e.
$$
But we also have, 
\begin{align*}
e^T w & = (-A\Phi)^T(-CA\Phi)\\
& = \Phi^T A^T CA\Phi\\
& = \Phi^T K \Phi = \xi(\Phi).
\end{align*}
So therefore $C_e = \xi(\Phi)$ as required.
\end{proof}

# Spring-mass Systems

In this section we will consider a spring-mass system as a harmonic graph and through the usage 
of physical laws such as *Hookes'* and *Newton's second law* we will find a method for finding the 
position of the individual masses as a function of time.

## Hookes' Law

We will use two laws from physics to solve our problem so I shall briefly introduce them here.

Consider the spring-mass system described in the figure below, we can easily imagine the system as a harmonic 
graph with the node variables being the distance of each mass to their equilibrium positions (i.e. the displacements) 
$\phi_i = \hat{x}_i - x_i$ and the edge variables being the spring constants $c_i$.

\caption{A spring-mass system with three masses in two position in time.}
\end{figure}

Then *Hookes' law* states that the tension in spring $i$ is given by 
$$T_i = c_i (\phi_{i+1} - \phi_i). $$
Thus, by writing in matrix form, we have,
$$\mathbf{T} = C A \Phi,$$
where $\mathbf{T}$ is the tension vector, $C$ the spring constant vector, $A$ the incidence matrix 
and $\Phi$ the displacement vector.

Now by considering the sum of the tension connected to the $i$-th mass is the force experienced 
by that mass, we have,
$$- A^T \mathbf{T} = f,$$
where $f$ is the force vector denoting the force experienced by each mass.

## Boundary Condition

With this equation in mind, let us consider the boundary condition where the system is in equilibrium.

At equilibrium, the net force at each mass other than the boundary masses is zero. Suppose there is some 
external force acting on the system $f_{\text{ext}} = (f_i)^T$, then we have 
$$ f_{\text{ext}} + f = 0,$$
where $f = -A^TCA \Phi$, thus,
$$f_{\text{ext}} = A^T CA \Phi = K\Phi.$$

\begin{remark}
Note the similarity of this with the equation derived from circuits.
\end{remark}

## Spring-mass System in Motion

Now suppose that our system is no longer in equilibrium, then we can no longer assume the 
net force at each mass is zero; but we can instead utilize Newton's second law ($F = ma$), 
$$
f_{\text{ext}} + f = M \frac{d^2\mathbf{x}}{dt^2} = M \frac{d^2}{dt^2}(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_0) = M \frac{d^2\Phi}{dt^2},
$$
where $M := \text{diag}(m_1, \cdots, m_n)$ is the mass matrix, $\mathbf{x}$ is the position vector of 
the masses and $\mathbf{x}_0$ is the initial position of the masses. 
\begin{remark}
Note that the second equality is true since $\mathbf{x}_0$ is a constant.
\end{remark}
Thus, by rewritting the above equation, we have
$$
f_{\text{ext}} - K \Phi =  M \frac{d^2\Phi}{dt^2}.
$$

But now the question becomes: how do we solve such a system?

I will outline the main steps below and then elaborate on how to solve the differential equation as 
solving the boundary condition equation is exactly the same as what we have done for circuits.

- We will first find the general solution to the complementary function of the differential equation, i.e. the solution to 
the equation
$$ M \frac{d^2\Phi}{dt^2} + K \Phi_{\text{CF}} = 0. $$
- Then I will find a particular solution to the boundary condition equation,
$$f_{\text{ext}} = K\Phi.$$
- Then general solution will simply be the sum of the complementary function with the particular solution.

To solve $M \frac{d^2\Phi}{dt^2} + K \Phi_{\text{CF}} = 0$, we will use the eigenvalue method. Suppose our solution is 
in the form $\Phi(t) = v \exp(i \omega t)$ for some $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$ and $v \in \mathbb{C}^n$. Then by subsituting $\Phi$ into 
our differential equation, we have 
$$-K(ve^{i\omega t}) = - \omega^2 v e^{i\omega t},$$
$$\implies K v = \omega^2 v,$$
thus $v$ is an eigenvector of $K$ (whose existence is guarenteed by the fact that $K$ is symmetric) so we have found 
$\Phi(t) = v\exp(i \omega t)$ satisfying the differential equation.

But now we've encountered the problem that our solution is not neccessarily real as $v \in \mathbb{C}^n$. Thus, by 
considering that, as both $K$ and $\omega^2$ are real, by taking the complex conjugate on both sides of the equation 
$$Kv = \omega^2 v,$$
we have,
$$K\bar{v} = \omega^2 \bar{v},$$ 
implying the conjugate of $v$ is also a eigenvector of $K$ with eigenvalue $\omega^2$. Thus, with this, 
we can find the real-valued solutions of our differential equation by considering 
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{2}ve^{i \omega t} + \frac{1}{2} \bar{v}e^{-i \omega t} & = \Re\{ve^{i \omega t}\} \in \mathbb{R}\\
\frac{1}{2i}ve^{i \omega t} - \frac{1}{2i} \bar{v}e^{-i \omega t} & = \Im\{ve^{i \omega t}\} \in \mathbb{R}
\end{split}
$$
we have found real-valued soltuions to our differential equation and the complementary function would be 
the linear combination of the solutions. See [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jgsdhbwydjgt) for an example.

# As $n \to \infty$ and Beyond!

In this section we will consider a harmonic graph with $n$ nodes as $n \to \infty$. Physically, we can interpret 
this as the problem of finding the electric potiential at some position in a metal rod among other things.

We will first examine what happend to our model in a one dimensional case - as in the rod perspective and then 
we will also expand the system to a two dimensional case such the problem of finding the electric potiential 
on a metal plate. 

## Conductances in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$

Up to now, we have simply assigned a number to an edge saying that corresponds to its conductance without 
regard to the physical length of the wire or any other physical attributes. This was prefectly fine since 
we only cared for the 'topology' of the graph but it's less than ideal when working with one dimensional rods 
that conduct electricity. This is because as the rod increases in length, it is natural to expect it will be 
increasingly 'harder' for electrons to traverse the entire distance so the conductance should be negatively 
proportional to the length. With that in mind, we will define the conductance of a rod to be 
$$
c = \frac{\hat{c}}{L},
$$
where $\hat{c}$ is the *conductivity* of the metarial and $L$ the length of the rod.

Now, suppose that our wire is no longer one dimensional and has now a mysterious property called "width".
As the width of the rod increases, physically we can imagine there being more space for the electrons so we 
would expect the conductance to increase as the width increases. Hence, in a two dimensional case, we define the 
conductance as
$$c = \frac{H}{L}\hat{c},$$

Suppose we have a wire along the real interval $[0, 1]$ and we place $N + 1$ nodes equidistant apart, i.e. for all 
$i \in {0, 1, \cdots N}$ there is a node at the position $i / N$. Now let us denote the position of the $i$-th node 
on the inverval by $x_i$, and the potiential at this position by $\phi(x_i)$ thus $x_i = i / N = i \Delta x$ 
where $\Delta x = 1 / N$. 

Then by considering our incidence matrix $A_N$ for all $N$, we have $A_N \Phi$ being the potiential difference vector 
at each node i.e. $(A_N \Phi)_i = \phi(x_{i+1}) - \phi(x_i) = \Delta \phi_i$. Now, by defining the conductance between the $i+1$-th node 
and the $i$-node as $c_i / \Delta x$ (recall the reasoning above), we have $(-CA_N \Phi)_i = -c_i \frac{\Delta \phi_i}{\Delta x} = w_i$, 
where $w_i$ represent the current on the edge between the $i+1$-th and the $i$-th node.

Now, by considering $- A^T w = f$ where $f$ is the vector representing the sum of currents out of the nodes, 
let's define $\hat{f_i}\Delta x = (f)_i$, where $\hat{f_i}$ represents the source current density at the $i$-th node.
The reason why we are doing this is because the net current out of each node is dependent on the conductance of 
its neighbouring edges; but as $\Delta x \to 0$ the conductance tends to infinity  which doesn't have any physical representations. 
Thus, by dividing $f$ by $\Delta x$ we can recieve a notion of the density of the net current out of each position (also 
know as *electric flux*). Then, by rewritting, we have $(- A^T w)_i = w_{i+1} - w_i = \Delta w_i = \hat{f}_i \Delta x$.

Finally, by plugging in our equation for $w_i$, we have 
$$
\hat{f}_i = \frac{\Delta w_i}{\Delta x} = \frac{1}{\Delta x}\left(-c_i \frac{\Delta \phi_i}{\Delta x}\right),
$$
and as $N \to \infty$, we have $\Delta x \to 0$ and
$$
\hat{f}(x) = \frac{dw}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}\left(-c(x) \frac{d\phi}{dx}\right).
$$
(Oftentimes, we have $c(x)$ being a constant as the metarial throughout the rod is the same, then we can bring out $c$ 
from the derivative resulting in the differential equation $\hat{f}(x) = -c \frac{d^2 \phi}{dx^2}$.)

## 2-D Continuum Limit

Let's now consider the two dimensional limit. This time, rather having each node represeting some length $\Delta x$ that 
tends to 0, we will let each node represent some area $\Delta x \Delta y \to 0$. As we are working with a two dimensional plane 
alike the Cartesian coordinates, we will denote each node by a tuple of two numbers $i,j$. With that, we shall again define the 
soure density by $f_{i,j} = \hat{f}_{i,j} \Delta x \Delta y$. As argued before, we will also define the conductance at each position 
by $c = \hat{c} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$.

Then, by decomposing the contributing currents at each node into the $x$ and $y$ directions denoted by $u_i$ and $v_j$ we have,
$$
\begin{split}
u_{i+1} & = -c(\phi_{i+1, j}- \phi_{i,j}) = -\hat{c}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}(\phi_{i+1, j}- \phi_{i,j})\\
u_{i} & = -c(\phi_{i, j}- \phi_{i-1,j}) = -\hat{c}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}(\phi_{i, j}- \phi_{i-1,j})\\
v_{j+1} & = -c(\phi_{i, j+1}- \phi_{i,j}) = -\hat{c}\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}(\phi_{i, j+1}- \phi_{i,j})\\
v_{j} & = -c(\phi_{i, j}- \phi_{i,j-1}) = -\hat{c}\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}(\phi_{i, j}- \phi_{i,j-1})
\end{split}
$$
where $\phi_{i,j}$ is the potiential at the $i,j$-th node.

Then as $u_{i+1} - u_{i} + v_{j+1} - v_{j} = \hat{f}_{i,j} \Delta x \Delta y$, we have 
$$
\begin{split}
\hat{f}_{i,j} & = \frac{1}{\Delta x \Delta y}(u_{i+1} - u_{i} + v_{j+1} - v_{j})
\end{split}
$$
